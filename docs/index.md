# Welcome

Welcome to the [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System For Oculus Rift](https://github.com/aiial/all-detection-system-for-oculus-rift) official documentation.

&nbsp;

# Introduction

The **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System For Oculus Rift** Combines [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/)'s Virtual Reality technologies with a Deep Learning classifier to provide real-time classification of [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia](https://www.leukemiaairesearch.com/research/leukemia) in peripheral blood samples within a Virtual Reality environment.

The classifier used in this project is the [HIAS Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classifier](https://github.com/aiial/all-detection-system-for-oculus-rift) which is trained on the [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all) dataset. The classifier achieves 97% accuracy at detecting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Lymphoblasts in images of peripheral blood samples.

# DISCLAIMER

_This project should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the project is to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality for medical support systems such as diagnostic systems._

_Although the model used is accurate and shows good results both on paper and in real world testing, it is trained on a small amount of data and needs to be trained on larger datasets to really evaluate it's accuracy._

_Developers that have contributed to this repository have experience in using Artificial Intelligence for detecting certain types of cancer. They are not doctors, medical or cancer experts._
